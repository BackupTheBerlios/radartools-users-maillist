<PRE>Hello Daniel,

at first, in the name of all developers, thank you for your nice
words, it's always motivating.

I am not at all a specialist for geology or volcanic conduits. I just
want to give some ideas for your task using RAT Polarimetry, and
perhaps somebody else can help you more.

In general, the covariance matrix represents the statistics
(second-order) of your data. Presuming sums up neighboring pixels into
one. That is, it determines the spatial resolution of your data (after
covariance matrix generation), and the number of independent looks
(samples).
For example, giving the values of 4 for azimuth and 2 for range will
result in a resolution of 18m x 20m = 360m^2, and every pixel will
have 8 looks. The higher the number of looks over homogeneous areas,
the better and more reliable are the statistics and the better is the
estimation of the true covariance matrix which represents best your
data. Additionally, you can apply speckle filters (whom do not reduce
the image size) to obtain more looks and get more smooth images.

Since you work with natural media you'll probably need a lot of looks,
either you want to use the backscattering coefficients or the whole
covariance matrices.

You may consider different kinds of polarimetric decompositions to see
either they are sensitive to the parameters which you are interested
in.
One is the Entropy-Alpha-Anisotropy decomposition (developed, btw, at
your university, in Nantes). Entropy gives you the entropy of the
scattering mechanisms, the alpha-angle can be related to the
scattering mechanism type, and anisotropy gives you information about
secondary scattering mechanisms.
But consider also to use the Freeman-Durden (Surface-Volume-Double
Bounce), or the Sphere-Diplane-Helix decompositions, for example.
You can also try to use the classification methods (H/a and H/a/A
segmentations, Lee category preserving, physical, Wishart, etc.) and
see either they can distinguish between the different media which you
have in the data.

Best regards,
Maxim

</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to understand what a covariance matrix can be used to. I

</I>&gt;<i> what are the relationships with what I see on the ground? How can I
</I>&gt;<i> relate the matrix with
</I>&gt;<i> something useful for humidity, rugosity etc.?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - During processing I was also asked for presumming. Although I have
</I>&gt;<i> also tried to
</I>&gt;<i> understand which numbers I am to report there, what I am asked for is
</I>&gt;<i> still pretty obscure.
</I>&gt;<i> Does it depend on the azimuth/range resolution ratio? The images have a
</I>&gt;<i> resolution of
</I>&gt;<i> 4.5 meters in azimuth, and 10 meters in range. Am I to respond 1 for

</I>&gt;<i> 2.2 (=10/4.5) for range ?

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help !
