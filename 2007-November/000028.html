<PRE>Dear RAT users,

In spite of my very limited SAR processing skills, I find RAT pretty 
easy to use,
and (given this is my first participation to the list) I would like 
first to warmly thank
the developers for such a nice, nice work made available to everyone, 
which gives
to non-SAR specialists the feeling that they are clever enough to master 
what
only a tiny fraction of human beings can actually understand.

I am not Jedi Master Yoda though, and I have a question about the 
covariance matrix.
I am working with PALSAR data and I am interested in using the various
polarization modes available (I have both SLC and ML images) to retrieve 
which
properties of linear volcanic conduits observed at surface are actually 
observed.
These geologic features may be observed due to their topography, the 
specific
vegetation they are associated to, or water channelling along them. For
the moment, what I do is trying to interpret the various polarization modes
separately, as a function of what I have found on books or promotional 
materials
of space agencies (HH is more sensible to humidity than VV etc.). My two 
questions are :

- Using RAT, I can readily get a covariance matrix. The covariance 
matrix image is great.
I have tried to understand what a covariance matrix can be used to. I 
have found tens
(tons) of papers with lots of mathematics in it but none appears to 
answer the question of
what I can do with that. As a 3*3 matrix, I guess it contains plenty of 
useful numbers, but
what are the relationships with what I see on the ground? How can I 
relate the matrix with
something useful for humidity, rugosity etc.?

- During processing I was also asked for presumming. Although I have 
also tried to
understand which numbers I am to report there, what I am asked for is 
still pretty obscure.
Does it depend on the azimuth/range resolution ratio? The images have a 
resolution of
4.5 meters in azimuth, and 10 meters in range. Am I to respond 1 for 
azimuth and
2.2 (=10/4.5) for range ?

Thanks for your help !
